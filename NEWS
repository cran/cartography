cartography version 1.2 (Release date: 2016-02-11)
==============

Major changes:
* The OpenStreetMap package used to display OpenStreetMap tiles has been replaced by the rosm package. rosm installation is lighter and easier (no Java dependency).
* The k parameter is deprecated in propSymbolsLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer and propSymbolsChoroLayer. The inches parameter is to be used instead. This modification allows to compare proportionnal symbols maps. 

Minor changes:
* Introduce the getFigDim function that helps to find output figure dimension that fit a Spatial object dimension ratio.
* The discLayer function now returns a (invisible) SpatialLinesDataFrame of discontinuities.
* NAs are better managed in choroLayer.
* The graticule.spdf SpatialLinesDataFrame has been expanded. 
* The size of the title box in layoutLayer is fixed to 1.2 lines height.



cartography version 1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-18)
==============

Major changes:
* Correction of the proportionnal symbols legends (square, bar, circle, triangle). The previous version was incorrect (size proportionnal to radii and not surfaces).
* Add a gradLinkTypoLayer function to plot a layer of colored and graduated links.

Minor changes:
* choroLayer: small correction to allow to plot variable named "x" or "y".
* vignette: correct the name entry, incorrectly named "SpatialPosition"", to "cartography".
* Update of the figure in the README file.
* Darker, and more visible, south and north arrows.
