    various cartographic representations such as proportional symbols, chroropleth,
    typology, flows or discontinuities. In addition, it also proposes some useful
    features like cartographic palettes, layout (scale, north arrow, title...), labels,
    legends or access to cartographic API to ease the graphic presentation of maps.
