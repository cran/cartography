Description: Create and integrate maps in your R workflow. This package allows
    various cartographic representations such as proportional symbols, chroropleth,
    typology, flows or discontinuities maps. It also offers several features enhancing 
    the graphic presentation of maps like cartographic palettes, layout 
    elements (scale, north arrow, title...), labels, legends or access to some 
    cartographic APIs. See Giraud and Lambert (2017) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-57336-6_13>.
